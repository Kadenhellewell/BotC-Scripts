This script is designed to be only slightly more complex than 'Trouble Brewing'. It is intended to provide a different and interesting experience for those who have played 'Trouble Brewing' many times, while still keeping it approachable for new (but not necessarily brand new) players. EDit: In practice, this script is actually quite a bit more complicated than intended. 

Note that this script is not usually great for sub 6 players.
