# Blood on the Clocktower Scripts

This repository is for storing custom scripts for [Blood on the Clocktower](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/).

## Repository Structure

Each directory in this repository contains a unique script. Inside each script directory, you will find:
- The script's PDF file
- The script's JSON file

Both files should be present for each script.

## Creating or Editing Scripts

To create or modify scripts, use the official [Blood on the Clocktower Script Tool](https://script.bloodontheclocktower.com/):

1. To edit an existing script, upload its JSON file to the tool.
2. Make changes as desired.
3. Download both the updated PDF and JSON files.
4. Add or update the files in this repository, ensuring they are placed together in a single directory for the script.

Always follow the convention that each script's directory contains its PDF and JSON files.
