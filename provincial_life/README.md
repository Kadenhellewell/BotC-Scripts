# Provincial Life

This script is themed around the charm and intrigue of small-town living. All roles are inspired by the kinds of people you might find in a close-knit community. Thematically, evil could be lurking anywhere—your psychopathic neighbor, your sinister twin, or even your overly chatty friend, the Yaggababble. Expect a game where anyone could be hiding a dark secret, and the familiar faces of the town may not be as innocent as they seem.
